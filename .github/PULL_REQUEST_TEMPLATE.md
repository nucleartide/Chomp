## Dev checklist

* [ ] **First draft**. Implement a working first pass at the feature. If it helps, try thinking about data (model), presentation (view), and logic (controller).
	* [ ] **Design by contract**. Write pre-condition, post-condition, and invariant assertions to catch bugs before playtesting.
	* [ ] **Unit tests**. If needed, write unit tests to tease out edge cases.
	* [ ] **First playtest**. Thoroughly playtest until you are confident that the feature (and existing features) work. This also exercises the code paths with contracts.
* [ ] **Final draft**. Perform a general review of `Files changed` and revise anything that needs to be cleaned up.
	* [ ] **Run unit tests**.
	* [ ] **Final playtest**. After the changes above, playtest through the game one last time to ensure that everything works.
* [ ] **Fill out the pull request template**. Self-explanatory.
* [ ] **Remember the GIFs**. Include a recording of what's going on!
* [ ] **Update readme**. Maintain a list of pull requests for easy access later.
* [ ] **Merge**. Merge into `master`.
* [ ] **Deliverable**. Push update to portfolio

## Release checklist

_Note: you can skip this if you need the time back. Only issue is you're trading off potential build stability._

* [ ] **Build**. Cut a new build in Unreal. If the game doesn't build, fix until it does.
* [ ] **Tag**. Once built, tag the latest commit on `master` with the latest version string.
* [ ] **Upload**. Upload build to Google Drive.
* [ ] **Link**. Add link to this pull request.
* [ ] **Retro**. Quick reflection on how things could have gone better.
* [ ] **Priorities**. Prioritize items on work board.
* [ ] **Next task**. Tee up a pull request for the next feature.
* [ ] **Get portfolio feedback**
