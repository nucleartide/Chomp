## Dev checklist

* [ ] **First draft**. Implement a working first pass at the feature.
* [ ] **Scientific debugging immediately after first draft**. Ensure that all features within this pull request have been [scientifically debugged](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi10/cse15L/c/method.php). For experimental observations, you can slap a `UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere)` on all data fields, but you can also draw debug geometry for trickier logic.
* [ ] **Final draft**. Perform a general review of `Files changed` and revise anything that needs to be cleaned up.
* [ ] **Playtest**. Playtest through game to ensure everything works.
* [ ] **Merge and release**. Merge into `master`, cut a new build in Unreal, and upload a GitHub release.
* [ ] Do a CAR/STAR write-up describing your challenge, action, and result. This is important! No one cares about the game, the interesting part is in how you built it.

## After a break

* [ ] **Summary**. Collect changelog items from `Files changed`.
* [ ] **Priorities**. Prioritize items on work board.
* [ ] **Next task**. Tee up a pull request for the next feature.
