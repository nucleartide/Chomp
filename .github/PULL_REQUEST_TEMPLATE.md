## Dev Checklist

* [ ] **First draft**. Implement a working first pass at the feature/problem.
* [ ] **Final draft**. Perform a general review of `Files changed` and revise anything that needs to be cleaned up.
* [ ] **Modularity**. Review the architecture of your changes (see Unreal's Reference Viewer as well as the C++ header files), and ensure modules remain decoupled.
* [ ] **Build**. Build the game to ensure it remains bug-free, then upload to GitHub.

## Presentation Checklist
