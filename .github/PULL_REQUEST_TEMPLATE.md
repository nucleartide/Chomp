* [ ] **Final draft**. Perform a general review of `Files changed` and revise anything that needs to be cleaned up.
* [ ] **Final playtest**. After the changes above, playtest through the game one last time to ensure that everything works.
* [ ] **Fill out the changelog**. Self-explanatory.
* [ ] **So what**. Describe the challenge, action, tradeoffs, and result. This is important! Why should a game studio manager care about your work? Update your readme with this documented pull request.

## After a break
