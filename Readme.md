## ðŸ‘€ Review the development process

In addition to the game itself, the Chomp project also intends to demonstrate how a game made in Unreal Engine 5 comes together, and the tradeoffs that were made under particular time and resource constraints.

A post-mortem technical write-up will be published when the project is done. Until then, here is a list of pull requests (categorized by gameplay system) that document the development process:
