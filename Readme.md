# Chomp

> *A game about chomping on foods and avoiding ghosts, that demonstrates and speaks to the end-to-end process of shipping a game in Unreal Engine. Made in UE 5.2.*

(TODO: Need an eye-catching GIF here.)

## ðŸŽ® Play the game

Please see the [latest releases](https://github.com/nucleartide/Chomp/releases) for a download link.

## Rationale

*Chomp* is an Unreal Engineâ€“adaptation of the game mechanics that you see in *Pacman*.

As such, you can use this project as a reference point for creating games in Unreal. Whether:

- you're looking for examples of coding best practices in Unreal, or
- you are a Unity dev curious about how to construct Unreal projects, or
- you are simply looking for code examples that are more complex than usual coding tutorials,

This project will have something for you.

Take a look at the list of topics below to study the coding problems that are relevant to your own games:

### C++ versus Blueprints

...

### UI management

...

### Level editing and level generation

...

### A* implementation

...

### AI and Behavior Tree (BT) implementation

...
