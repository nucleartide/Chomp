# Chomp

> *A game about chomping on foods and avoiding ghosts, that demonstrates and speaks to the end-to-end process of shipping a game in Unreal Engine. Made in UE 5.2.*

## Play the game

Please see the [latest releases](https://github.com/nucleartide/Chomp/releases) for a download link.

## Rationale

*Chomp* is a modern, 3D implementation of the game mechanics that you see in *Pacman*.

As such, you can use this project as a reference point for creating games in Unreal — whether you are a Unity developer curious about how to construct Unreal projects, or you're looking for examples of coding best practices in Unreal, or you are simply looking for code examples that are more complex than usual tutorial code.
